Description of files:

G.txt contains a representation of the generator matrix G.
G.txt contains 1723 rows, one for each row of G. Each row
has integers ranging from 0 to 2047 separated by spaces. Each integer
represents the column index of the “1” entries in the specific row. 
All other entries of G are “0” and are not referenced in G.txt.

H.txt contains a representation of the parity check matrix H that may
be used to decode the codewords encoded by the generator matrix G. H.txt
contains 325 rows, one for each row of H. Each row has integers ranging
from 0 to 2047 separated by commas. Each integer represents the column
index of the “1” entries in the specific row. All other entries of H
are “0” and are not referenced in H.txt.

row_swap.txt describes row permutations of H that can put it in pseudo-lower
triangular form.

col_swap.txt contains column permutations that were used to obtain H from an
earlier version of the parity check matrix.

H.txt, row_swap.txt and col_swap.txt are informative.
